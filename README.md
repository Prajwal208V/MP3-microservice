## Deploying a Python-based Microservice Application on AWS EKS

### Introduction

This document provides a step-by-step guide for deploying a Python-based microservice application on AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). The application comprises four major microservices: `auth-server`, `converter-module`, `database-server` (PostgreSQL and MongoDB), and `notification-server`.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

1. **Create an AWS Account:** If you do not have an AWS account, create one by following the steps [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/setting-up.html).
2. **Install Helm:** Helm is a Kubernetes package manager. Install Helm by following the instructions provided [here](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).
3. **Python:** Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
4. **AWS CLI:** Install the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) following the official [installation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).
5. **Install kubectl:** Install the latest stable version of `kubectl` on your system. You can find installation instructions [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).
6. **Databases:** Set up PostgreSQL and MongoDB for your application.
